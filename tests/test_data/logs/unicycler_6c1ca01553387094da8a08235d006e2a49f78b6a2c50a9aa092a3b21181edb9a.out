[2m    Unicycler uses long read alignments (from minimap) to resolve simple repeat[0m
[2mstructures in the graph. This takes care of some "low-hanging fruit" of the[0m
[2mgraph simplification.[0m

Aligning long reads to graph using minimap

[2m    Two-way junctions are defined as cases where two graph contigs (A and B)[0m
[2mjoin together (C) and then split apart again (D and E). This usually represents[0m
[2ma simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:[0m
[2m(A‚ÜíC‚ÜíD and B‚ÜíC‚ÜíE) or (A‚ÜíC‚ÜíE and B‚ÜíC‚ÜíD). Each read which spans such a junction[0m
[2mgets to "vote" for option 1, option 2 or neither. Unicycler creates a bridge at[0m
[2meach junction for the most voted for option.[0m

No suitable two-way junctions present

[2m    Simple loops are parts of the graph where two contigs (A and B) are[0m
[2mconnected via a repeat (C) which loops back to itself (via D). It is possible[0m
[2mto traverse the loop zero times (A‚ÜíC‚ÜíB), one time (A‚ÜíC‚ÜíD‚ÜíC‚ÜíB), two times[0m
[2m(A‚ÜíC‚ÜíD‚ÜíC‚ÜíD‚ÜíC‚ÜíB), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is the[0m
[2mcorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each is[0m
[2maligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its "vote" for the loop[0m
[2mcount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most voted[0m
