Why Use plassembler?
---------
plassembler is primarily intended for high-throughput users with hybrid ONT/short read bacterial sequencing data who want accurate plasmid assemblies.

I developed plassembler because, if conducting Flye assembly alone (and using short reads to polish the assemblies), plasmid assemblies would often be duplicated or triplicated, which would bias downstream analyses involving measures such as plasmid copy numbers.

I also noticed that short read assemblies of plasmids alone would often fail to assemble some plasmids into one circularised contig, due to repetitive elements such as transposons.
